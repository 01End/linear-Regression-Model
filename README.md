# Linear Regression Model üè†üìä

A simple linear regression project using house pricing data. This notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features in `house_data.csv`.

## Project Overview

You‚Äôll find code in a Jupyter notebook (`linear regression model.ipynb`) that walks through:

- Understanding the data (basic EDA)  
- Cleaning / preparing data  
- Training a linear regression model  
- Evaluating performance (metrics like MSE, RMSE, etc.)  
- Possible improvements  

---

## Dataset

- File: `house_data.csv`  
- Contains features relevant to predicting house prices (e.g. square footage, number of rooms, location, etc.).  
- Cleaned data assumed; if there are missing values or categorical features, those are handled in preprocessing steps in the notebook.
